I'm developing a video game in HOMM-like universe.
The premise is that you've possessed a hermit mage guild master who lives solitary life in a deteriorated guild. Now you're going to restore the guild, recruit members etc.

The player sees such intro:

We've established a telepathic link to a new worldâ€”one with <b>magic</b>.
To access these resources, we need a stable gateway built from both sides.
The plan: possess an isolated guild master who have the necessary infrastructure.
Several candidates exist across different regions. Choose the region.

Once they've chosen the region they start possessing the guild master.
They they are presented with an input box which says:
Type in words which you believe might help
type a magic noun and hit Enter

Entering a meaningful word gives them possession points.

Now I need large list of words which the user might type. I want to anticipate what they might type and reward them for practically every word that possibly makes sense in the context of possession.

The words are single nouns lowercase. The shortest form of the word is used (i.e. 'dark' instead of 'darkness' or 'farm' instead of 'farmer'. So even if their meanings are different, the shorter form is preferred anyway)
