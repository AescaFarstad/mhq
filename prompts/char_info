I'm developing a video game in HOMM-like universe.
The premise is that you've possessed a hermit mage guild master who lives solitary life in a deteriorated guild. Now you're going to restore the guild, recruit members etc.

I want to give the player a choice between six candidates: three male and three female. They each should be knowledgeable in magic - have at least some connection to it, be at least a little proficient in at least one of the schools. But also have other strengths - each a unique one.

attribute at 2  is the default
1 - underdeveloped
3 - developed
4 - exceptional
5 - genius //super rare

distribute roughly 8-10 attribute points
~13-15 skill points
~13-15 specialization points

Could be more or less, depending on what makes sense. Could be fewer attributes but more skills, or fewer skills but more specializations etc
Note that a specialization can only be taken if the skill is at least level 1.

The characters at the start are not particularly exceptional. They may be guild masters, but this is all by mistake :) and because they are alone.

The bio must be brief - 2-3 sentences.

Bio should tell the player about who this character was. But not their personality (as the player will replace them). The player will use bio to make guesses about proficiency of each character.
Bios should also give a glimpse into how they became guild masters and why they ended up alone.

Some characters should have underdeveloped attributes.
Throw in a few useless skills/specializations - they will enrich the believability of the character.
